"There's a little devil inside all of us."

Beneath their manufactured perception - their artificial reality - is a
writhing, twisted mess of dread. Loathing. Judgment. Elitism. Self-doubt.
All thrashing to escape the feeble hold of their host, seeping through every
little crevice they can find. Into their willpower, starving them of all
motivation and desire. Into their stomach, forcing them to drown their guilt in
comfort food. Or into a newly-opened gash in their skin, hidden only by the
sleeves of a cute new shirt.
Such a deplorable, tangled mass is already present in every single one of them.
That's why I choose not to blame myself for their actions.

All I did was untie the knot.

“每个人心中都有一个小恶魔。”

在她们人为制造的感知--她们的人造现实--之下，是一团扭曲的恐惧。
厌恶。
评判。
精英主义。
自我怀疑。
它们都在抽打，从它们能找到的每一个小缝隙中渗入，以逃离宿主的虚弱控制。
转化为她们的意志力，让她们失去了所有的动力和欲望。
灌进她们的胃里，迫使她们用舒适的食物来掩饰她们的罪恶感。
或者变成皮肤上新开的一道伤口，只隐藏在一件可爱的新衬衫的袖子里。
这样一个可悲的、纠缠的团块已经存在于其中的每一个人身上。
这就是为什么，我选择不为她们的行为责备自己。

而我所做的，就是解开这个结。
